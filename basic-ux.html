            <h2>03.01.01 Data Collection</h2>
            <p>For the data collection assignment we learned about different kinds of research; desk research, observation, interview, and survey. I did desk research on how virtual reality could help people dealing with dementia. I used five different articles from reputable sources and gathered information from them. I learned key insights, the broader context of the problem, and about similar efforts on the topic. </p>
            <p>When it came to observation I went to a Burger King and observed how people behaved. I planned the questions I would be answering beforehand, sat in a booth, observed and took notes, described the situation in detail, and finally analyzed and debriefed my findings.</p>
            <p>For the Interview I interviewed my roommate about social media. It was an informal interview with open questions and deeper questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the survey my partner and I used open ended, multiple choice, and closed questions, to get to know the challenges of getting to meet people as an international student in Copenhagen. The most surprising thing we learned was that international students have different problems when it comes to making friends, even though they have a similar demographic.

            <h2>03.03.01 Prototype </h2>
            <p>For this assignment we learned about conventions and functionality in websites. We had to create a XD prototype using UI kits, for a website which new students in Copenhagen could use to find jobs, events, and housing. I researched different webpages for students in Denmark in order to get an understanding of convention, content, and functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The conclusion I came up with after the research was that our prototype should be inviting and professional. Since the “sender” would be the Ministry of Higher Education. I took inspiration from the different sites when it came to color, layout, and tone.

            <h2>03.04.01 Design Sprint</h2>
            <p>The Design sprint was the largest assignment during this theme and it brought together so many aspects of what we learned through the theme and the semester. We learned about mapping, sketching, deciding, prototyping, and testing. We also learned that in a design sprint there are key roles, such as facilitator and decider. I took on the role of decider during this design sprint. Whenever there was a tough decision I took the lead and made a decision for the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a team we mapped out an app that would help students and teachers resources for events around the city. Throughout the sprint we refined the idea and ended up creating an app prototype to find “hangouts” for students. Since there was no other platform offering this service.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Tuesday we sketched out different implementations for our solution. We used the crazy 8’s method. We voted on the best implementations and chose them as a priority.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Wednesday we had to decide which solutions to implement. I facilitated our conversation and decision process on this day. One or two decisions had to be made by myself because our group was split. We worked in harmony throughout the process and put honesty and communication at the center of everything we did. This way we made sure to keep out goal and solution above everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                We storyboarded our app so that on Thursday we would be ready to prototype our solution. When our prototype was ready, we interviewed potential users. We then implemented their feedback into our app prototype so that we could prepared our pitch.
            </p>
            <p>
                I prepared the script that we based our pitch on and helped create the Prezi we would use to pitch our solution.
