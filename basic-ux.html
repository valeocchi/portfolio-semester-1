        <h2>03.01.01 Data Collection</h2>
        <p>For the data collection assignment we learned about different kinds of research; desk research, observation, interview, and survey. I did desk research on how virtual reality could help people dealing with dementia. I used five different articles from reputable sources and gathered information from them. I learned key insights, the broader context of the problem, and about similar efforts on the topic. </p>
        <p>When it came to observation I went to a Burger King and observed how people behaved. I planned the questions I would be answering beforehand, sat in a booth, observed and took notes, described the situation in detail, and finally analyzed and debriefed my findings.</p>
        <p>For the Interview I interviewed my roommate about social media. It was an informal interview with open questions and deeper questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the survey my partner and I used open ended, multiple choice, and closed questions, to get to know the challenges of getting to meet people as an international student in Copenhagen. The most surprising thing we learned was that international students have different problems when it comes to making friends, even though they have a similar demographic.
