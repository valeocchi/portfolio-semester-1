        <h1>Theme 5: Basic Content</h1>
        <h2>05.02.01 Foodsharing Copenhagen</h2>
        <p>In basic content we learned about shooting and editing video. For the campaign site video my group and I created I edited the video. I also applied color correction that we learned in class to make the video more appealing. I also made 3 different versions of the campaign video that could be used on social media. A short 30second version, and a vertical video for snapchat or Instagram stories. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, I helped sketch out the campaign site and provided ideas for the user experience to be optimal. Our sites goal was to be a resource to eliminate food waste at home, so our video contains information about ways to get the most out of the food you have. The rest of our site also includes information about food and how to properly store it and different ways to use it. The design was meant to be fun and inviting. This is the ultimate food saving resource. </p>
        <h2>05.02.03 Storyboard</h2>
        <p>We learned that creating a storyboard is a good way to know what exactly it is youâ€™re doing. I sketched the first version of our storyboard which included shots, angles, and props. This made the project very clear when we shot the video. We were very efficient and got it all done very quickly. The story board was also helpful through the editing process, since I knew what the video should look like.</p>
        <h2>05.02.04 Customer Pitch</h2>
        <p>When we created the pitch for the customer, we thought about what we learned in class. Why? How? And What? We created a pitch based on the fact that we want people to value their food, by allowing them to take control of their behavior. And our campaign site would be a resource to do that. </p>
        <p>I wrote and presented the introduction for our pitch, as well as help write other group members script for the pitch. </p>
