                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Valeria Occhi. I am a first semester International Multimedia Design student. This semester I’ve been learning about all the basics of multimedia design. From photoshop to Java Script. I came to this study with practically no knowledge about multimedia design. I have learned and grown so much since the beginning of the semester.
                </p>
                <p>I have always considered myself to be a creative person so I wanted to have an education that allowed be to play and continue to grow no matter what. I think I have found this in Multimedia Design. Although challenging, it has been a lot of fun to learn many new skills I didn’t have. This portfolio website is a reflection of how far I’ve come since the beginning of the semester. I would’ve never dreamt of making a site like this.
                </p>
                <p>I look forward to continue to grow in multimedia design and use it as a tool to make content about different topics.
