            <h2>04.01.01 Sprite Animation on Background</h2>
            <p>During the Basic Animation theme we learned about character design and how to make it come to life in Illustrator. I created a SVG cloud in Illustrator. It was a misunderstood hero, who just wanted to save people from a sun burn from the Sun character. </p>
            <p>My animation waves and sticks their tongue out. They are placed on a background with some birds flying and a mountain range in the background. Also created in Illustrator. I achieved this through making different frames in illustrator that play one after another because of CSS properties applied to them.</p>

            <h2>04.02.01 Javascript Controlled Animation</h2>
            <p>During this assignment we had to put into practice what we learned with Javascript. For this assignment I created 10 different animations in CSS and gave them specific selector names. I then created different buttons that would turn on and off these animations. </p>
            <p>With Javascript I used the queryselector to apply a CSS selector to the animation. I also used classlist.toggle and classlist.remove to turn off the other animations when another one would be clicked. </p>
            <p>The svg format for my character made it scalable and looked very smooth with all animations that were applied. </p>

            <p>For the project pool 1 my partner and I created a silly sound machine that can be controlled with the keyboard. We learned about the event listeners keydown and keyup. We applied these in order to make the keyboard buttons start and stop the sounds. </p>

            <h2>04.04.01 Onboarding</h2>
            <p>We learned about gamification for this assignment. When my group and I were creating the concept for our onboarding we thought about applying gamification elements throughout. Our onboarding is based on a character going through their first day as a multimedia design student. We made different “levels” for the character to go through, and a final prize at the end as part of the gamification aspect.</p>
            <p>For the onboarding assignment I was part of the concept creation, as well as writing all copy and microcopy for the whole game. I applied what we learned about illustrator when creating backgrounds for the game. </p>
