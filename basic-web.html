        <h1>Theme 2: Basic Web</h1>
        <h2>02.04.01 Responsive Website</h2>
        <p>In the Basic Web theme we learned about content production. Part of this was learning about color and how it can improve the design of a website. My responsive website had a lot of content about the Bauhaus art movement. I chose a color palette inspired by Bauhaus architecture in Tel Aviv. The pallet uses complementary colors to attract attention. However, it is still a calm and elegant color pallet.</p>
        <p>We also learned about typography and about the mood that it can set for a viewer. I used the fonts Ubuntu and Avenir. I used these sans serif font to keep in line with the minimalism of the Bauhaus art movement.
        </p>
        <p>When designing icons and sketches we learned about skeuomorphic and flat design. I chose a flat design for my website logo because it is easier to make it scalable. I wanted my logo to be versatile for different screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We learned about how websites should be responsive and have different breaking points depending on screen size. I created a responsive website with three different breaking points, keeping in mind that a user might be on their mobile, tablet, or laptop/desktop.
